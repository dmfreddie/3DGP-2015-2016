# Spice My Sponza - ICA1

Result : 90%

ICA Requirements:
* Create geometry meshes from the Sponza scene data (which contains indexed triangle lists);
* Draw instances of meshes from the Sponza scene using camera data it contains;
* Implement the full transformation pipeline (model, view and projection transforms);
* Shade the scene using the Phong reflection model with the point light data (including distance attenuation) and per-instance material data from the Sponza scene data (including diffuse and specular coefficients from texture maps);
* Implement a key press feature toggle that additionally draws the surface normal vector at each vertex with emissive shading based upon their world space value (but not affected by the virtual lighting).
